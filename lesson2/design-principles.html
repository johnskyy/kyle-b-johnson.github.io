            Herman Miller is a furniture company that caters to professional,
            office-oriented customers. As such, they pride themselves on having
            modern, ergonomic designs. They are also a business so they are
            naturally going to have desired user interactions or products that
            they want to highlight. These diesired pages and outcomes are
            highlighted on the home page. Additionally, as products are viewed,
            the aspects of the product that the marketing team (or others) want
            to highlight are going to be more prominent on the respective
            webapge and take up a larger portion of the viewport's real estate.

            The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) houses a large
            collection of Modern and Contemporary art pieces, as such, they have
            a fairly design-forward website. One such example is their visitor's
            guide as linked above. This page has a fairly large amount of
            information but they manage to keep the top banner image, and most
            information tiles to about 1/3 of the screen size and the main
            information tile comprises about 2/3 of the viewport while it is
            within the viewport.

          <p>
            Grød is a small chain of porridge restaurants in Denmark. Their
            product maybe fairly simple, but they put an emphasis on clean
            tastes and flavors and they employ a website that mirrors that
            philosophy. They manage to organize the page so that there is
            minimal "fluff" which allows for the images to speak for themselves
            as well as creating just enough space for the next item in the page
            to creep into view providing just enough information to intrigue the
            user.
