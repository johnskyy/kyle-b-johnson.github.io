          <h3>Persona 1</h3>
          <p>Jim is a farmer and wants to have an easily accessible and easy to use site to 
            check the local weather for his ranch in Preston. He is likely to use the site 
            from a mobile device. He is getting on in years, and doesn't always have his 
            glasses with him. As a result, he needs a site that can easily scale and is 
            easy to read.
          </p>
          <h3>Persona 2</h3>
          <p>Tim works in Logan but has a cabin outside of Fish Haven. He often has the 
            weather at the cabin pulled up on his computer. He appreciates a site that is
            easy to use and has clean design. He likes to check the weather to be able to
            know the best weeks/weekends to take family up to the cabin, or which weeks he
            should have it available on Airbnb.
