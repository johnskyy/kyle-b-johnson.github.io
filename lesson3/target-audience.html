          <p>
            Jim is a farmer and wants to have an easily accessible and easy to
            use site to check the local weather for his ranch in Preston. He is
            likely to use the site from a mobile device. He is getting on in
            years, and doesn't always have his glasses with him. As a result, he
            needs a site that can easily scale and is easy to read.
          </p>
          <h4>Persona 2</h4>
          <p>
            Tim works in Logan but has a cabin outside of Fish Haven. He often
            has the weather at the cabin pulled up on his computer. He
            appreciates a site that is easy to use and has clean design. He
            likes to check the weather to be able to know the best
            weeks/weekends to take family up to the cabin, or which weeks he
            should have it available on Airbnb.
